6. Function Architecture

The function architecture for our system can be divided into 6 subsystems: User 
& UI,
Communication, Sensing, Motion, Gripping, and Power.


6.1.     Control     &     UI     Function
Architecture

This part of the system includes the
operator,  the  control  system  and  the
user    interface.    Once    the    operator
obtains  the  info  sent  back  from  the
video feeds and sensors, her or she can
either  actively  sending  various  kinds
of    commands    to    the    system,    or
monitor  the  system  as  it  carries  out

certain tasks by itself, such as auto-detecting suspicious bags or packages.

6.2.    Communication    Function
Architecture

This     subsystem     deals     with
sending  all  the  data  back  and  forth
between     the      remotely-operated
system and the operator.

6.3. Sensing Function Architecture

The sensing part of the system consists of a
pair  of  cameras  and  onboard  sensors.  When
surveying  the  environment,  the  operator  will
have  a  bird’s  eye  view  from  UAV.  Once  the
system is near the suspected explosive device,
the  operator  will  further  inspect  the  device
with sensing data and video feed from UGV.

6.4. Motion Function Architecture

The motion part enables the whole system to
move around. The UAV will have the ability to
follow  the  UGV  around  closely,  and  the  UGV
needs  to  be  able  to  traverse  different  kinds  of
terrain and minor obstacles.


6.5. Gripping Function Architecture

The  gripping  subsystem  is  a  manipulator  arm  capable  of
picking up the explosive and either holding it with the gripper
or placing it in a basket on the back of the UGV.

6.6. Power Function Architecture

The  last  subsystem,  power,  is  simply  the  part  of  providing  power.
The power system also has a minor but crucial function that it would
send out a warning signal to the operator when the battery of UAV is
running out, so the operator can make the UAV land on top of UGV.

7. Physical Architecture

There are four parts to our system’s physical architecture: operator, central 
control & UI,
UAV, and UGV & Manipulator.
